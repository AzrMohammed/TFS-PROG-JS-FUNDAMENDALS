\
\
Add atlease minimum of 5 products with different specification to allProducts
\
\
write a function that takes array of products as input and returns the total amount by adding the price of each product
\
\
call the created function by passing the allProducts value and save the value returned by the function in a variable productsTotalAmount
\
\
write a function that total price as input and if total price is on or above 100 apply 25 discount on the total price and call [success fuction](https://github.com/AzrMohammed/TFS_PROG_L01/blob/e3886a214cde085bf18f7e48458147fcb9b92df8/PROG/P02/03%20Functions%20P01/07%20Exercises/L1-02-Function-To-Print-Success/01%20Problem%20Statement.md) if less than 100 call [failure function](https://github.com/AzrMohammed/TFS_PROG_L01/blob/e3886a214cde085bf18f7e48458147fcb9b92df8/PROG/P02/03%20Functions%20P01/07%20Exercises/L1-01-Function-To-Print-Failure/01%20Problem%20Statement.md)
