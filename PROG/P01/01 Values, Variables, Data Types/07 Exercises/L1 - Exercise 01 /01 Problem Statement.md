# Problem Statement

Create list of 40 variables with values and its datatype    
Create the variables from the items that is in your life style (Refer Sample Section)    

## Rules

* variable name should always start with small letter  (for most of the cases)
    * Ex : variable name as "age" not  "Age" or "AGE"
* Variable name should be self explanatory as much as possible
    * Example 1: lets create a variable for gst percent
        * 1 : gst = 20
        * 2 : gstPercent = 20
        * In the above both defines the gst percent but the 2nd is more clear in a way that it wont require any further clarificaation or introduce any confusion in long run
        * The easiest way to find is hide the right part of the reclaration and see the name alone it should be self explanatory with out the reference of value
* variable name with more than one word should use camal notation -> after first word all the following word's  first letter will be of capital
    * Example:
        * gstPrice
        * myName
        * productPrice
        * myLaptopBrand
