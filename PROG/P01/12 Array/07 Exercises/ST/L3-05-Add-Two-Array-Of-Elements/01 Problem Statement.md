# Problem Statement   

There are two arrays with individual values, write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of each individual index value from the given arrays. 
Sample array :
array1 = [1,0,2,3,4];
array2 = [3,5,6,7,8,13];
Expected Output :
[4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13] 

## Rules
* If given array is [2,0,0,3,4] & [3,4,5,7,1], add those element in the array which has same index and push those values in new array
    * Print "[5,4,5,10,5]"

## Sample I/O

> #### Sample Input 1:
> array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
> array2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>
> ##### Output:
> [2,4,6,8,10,12]

> #### Sample Input 2:
> array1 = [4,5,2,1] 
> array2 = [2,5,1,1]

> ##### Output:
> [6,10,3,2]
