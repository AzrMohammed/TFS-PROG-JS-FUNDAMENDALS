# Problem Statement   

Write a JS program that prints the result after evaluating arithmetic operations between two numbers of addition, multiplication, division, and modulus in JavaScript.

## Rules

* Print result of num1+num2 if operation is “add”
* Print result of num1-num2 if operation is “subtract”
* Print result of num1*num2 if operation is “multiply”
* Print result of num1/num2 if operation is “divide”
* Print result of num1%num2 if operation is “modulus”
* Else print “Invalid operation”
  consider we have a variables with values like
  num1 = 20;
  num2 = 10;
  operations = "add"; like that,
  then perform addition operation.
  print -->> 30; //(num1+num2) because operaion is addition

## Sample I/O

> #### Sample Input 1:
> num1 = 100
> num2 = 20
> operation  = "divide”
>
> ##### Output:
> 5

> #### Sample Input 2:
> num1 = 10
> num2 = 2
> operation  = "modulas"
>
> ##### Output:
> 0

> #### Sample Input 3:
> num1 = 100
> num2 = 2
> operation  = "multiply"
>
> ##### Output:
> 200
