# Problem Statement

By default declare a variable as "age" with integer value     
By default declare a variable as citizenType     
Write an algorithm to set the value for citizenType      
if age is greater than 60 the user is  “Senior citizen” , else  “not a senior citizen”     

## Rules

* Use only ternary operator to provide value to citizenType
* If age > 60
    * citizenType = “Senior citizen”
* If age <= 60
    * citizenType = “not a senior citizen”
