# Problem Statement

By default declare a variable as "age" with integer value     
By default declare a variable as isAdult     
Write an algorithm to set the value for isAdult      
if age is greater than 18 the isAdult is true if not set value of isAdult as false     

## Rules

* Use only ternary operator to provide value to isAdult
* If age > 18
    * isAdult = true
* If age <= 18
    * isAdult = false
